The restaurant's menu includes an email address where visitors can give feeback about their food. 

The manager wants you to create a tool that automatically sends him all the negative reviews so he can fix them, while automatically sending all the positive reviews to the owner, so the manager can ask for a raise.  

First build a model to **distinguish positive reviews and negative reviews including a rating with each reivew.**  
Ratings: 
* 1-2 stars count as "negative" 
* 3 stars count as "neural" 
* 4-5 stars count as "positive"
